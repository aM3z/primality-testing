# Testing for Compositeness

In this project, I use python to implement a classic algorithm, namely, the Miller-Rabin test for compositeness. I then compare its performance with that of a modern machine learning algorithm known as a Support Vector Machine (from scikit-learn).

## Web app 
The /webapp directory contains an implementation of the Miller-Rabin test as a simple Angular 2 web app. 

## Extras
The slides/ directory includes the materials used in a 15-minute presentation and the report/ directory includes a 21-page report on the topic.
