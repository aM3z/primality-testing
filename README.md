# Testing for Compositeness

In this project, I use python to implement a classic algorithm, namely, the Miller-Rabin test for compositeness. I then compare it performance with that of a modern machine learning algorithm called support vector machine (from scikit-learn). In order to demostrate the Miller-Rabin test, I also implemented it as a simple Angular 2 webapp. The slides/ directory includes the materials used in a 15-minute presentation and the report/ directory includes a 21-page report on the topic.
